## Problem Statement

Add activity panel icon and vscode publisher profile icon

## Goals

- Ensure the activity bar entry uses a visible kube9-branded PNG icon that works in light and dark themes
- Ensure the marketplace publisher profile shows the kube9 PNG icon with proper sizing and transparency

## Approach

- Capture icon requirements as new scenarios in the Initial Configuration feature
- Specify format, sizing, theme contrast, and packaging so implementation is unambiguous
