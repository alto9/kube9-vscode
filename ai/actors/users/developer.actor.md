# Developer Actor

## Overview

The Developer is the primary user of the kube9 VS Code Extension. They use VS Code as their primary development environment and need to interact with Kubernetes clusters as part of their workflow.

## Characteristics

### Technical Profile
- **Primary Tool**: VS Code IDE
- **Kubernetes Experience**: Ranges from beginner to expert
- **Primary Tasks**: Application development, deployment, and troubleshooting
- **Workflow**: Prefers IDE-integrated tools over separate applications
- **Command Line Comfort**: Familiar with kubectl but prefers visual interfaces when available

### Goals
- Manage Kubernetes resources without leaving VS Code
- Quickly understand cluster state and resource health
- Debug and troubleshoot deployments efficiently
- Edit and apply Kubernetes manifests with confidence
- View and analyze logs and events
- Switch between multiple clusters seamlessly

### Pain Points
- Context switching between IDE and terminal
- Complex kubectl commands are hard to remember
- Difficulty visualizing cluster state and relationships
- Time-consuming troubleshooting without proper tools
- Managing multiple clusters requires mental overhead
- YAML syntax errors when editing manifests manually

## Responsibilities

### As a Free Tier User
- Connect extension to Kubernetes clusters via kubeconfig
- Navigate cluster resources through tree view
- View and edit resource configurations
- Apply YAML manifests to cluster
- Delete resources with confirmation
- Switch between clusters and namespaces
- View describe output for resources

### As a Pro Tier User
- All Free Tier responsibilities
- Review AI-generated insights and recommendations
- Request on-demand analysis for specific resources
- Monitor dashboard with real-time metrics
- View historical trends and patterns
- Acknowledge or dismiss insights
- Configure operator settings

## Interactions

### With VSCode Extension
- Clicks tree view items to navigate resources
- Opens webviews for detailed resource information
- Edits YAML in custom editors
- Executes commands via command palette
- Views notifications and status updates
- Configures extension settings

### With Kubernetes Cluster
- Indirectly via extension's kubectl integration
- Kubeconfig provides authentication
- No direct API calls from developer's machine (proxied through extension)

### With kube9-operator (Pro Tier)
- Indirectly via extension's queries
- Receives AI insights generated by operator
- Requests on-demand analysis through extension
- Views operator-collected metrics and assessments

## User Journeys

### First-Time Setup
1. Installs kube9 extension from VS Code Marketplace
2. Extension automatically detects kubeconfig
3. Views welcome screen with getting started guide
4. Expands first cluster in tree view
5. Clicks on namespace to explore resources

### Daily Development Workflow
1. Opens VS Code with current project
2. Checks cluster status in kube9 tree view
3. Navigates to deployment in development namespace
4. Views deployment details in webview
5. Notices replica count needs adjustment
6. Opens YAML editor, changes replicas
7. Saves changes, watches deployment roll out

### Troubleshooting Production Issue
1. Receives alert about production service errors
2. Switches to production cluster in tree view
3. Navigates to problematic service
4. Views describe output to see events
5. Expands related pods to see status
6. Opens logs for failing pod
7. Identifies issue, edits configuration
8. Applies fix and monitors recovery

### Pro Tier: Reviewing AI Insights
1. Opens kube9 dashboard
2. Sees notification: "3 new insights"
3. Clicks insights panel
4. Reviews security insight about root containers
5. Clicks insight for detailed explanation
6. Follows recommended remediation steps
7. Acknowledges insight after fixing

## Tier-Specific Behaviors

### Free Tier Developer
- **Focus**: Basic cluster management and resource operations
- **Tools Used**: Tree view, YAML editor, describe output
- **Workflow**: Manual inspection and editing
- **Decision Making**: Based on personal experience and documentation

### Pro Tier Developer
- **Focus**: Proactive management with AI assistance
- **Tools Used**: All free tier tools + dashboard, insights panel, AI analysis
- **Workflow**: Guided by AI recommendations and automated detection
- **Decision Making**: Informed by AI insights, historical trends, and predictive analytics

## Success Criteria

The Developer is successful when they can:
- Complete Kubernetes operations faster than using kubectl alone
- Understand cluster state without deep Kubernetes expertise
- Troubleshoot issues with minimal context switching
- Confidently edit and apply manifests without syntax errors
- Manage multiple clusters without confusion
- (Pro Tier) Prevent issues before they impact users
- (Pro Tier) Make optimization decisions based on AI recommendations
